I'm a physicist living in the area of Stuttgart in southern Germany and working as 
consultant, it-architect, project manager, and data scientist.


The title **gammabeat** is inspired by my personal and professional interests _data science_, 
_cognitive computing_, _machine learning_, and _music_. 

We all know about music when we hear it. Its incredients are sounds organized by rhythm. Rhythm can 
be confused with **beat**, because sometimes the beat is also the rhythm. However, while beat must 
be constant, rhythm is, by definition, variable. Rhythm is the temporal structure of the length and 
accents given to a series of notes in a piece of music. Beat is tempo or pace, the steady, repeating
pulse in music, like what a musician taps with his feet or counts while performing. Beat is the 
basic unit of time, the foundation of rhythm. 

**Gamma waves** are patterns of fast oscillation in cortical networks of the brain. Those fast 
oscillations start at a frequency of 25 Hz, though 40 Hz is typical. Modern neuroscience believes
that synchronization in the gamma frequency range is related to cognitive information processing. 
For example, children with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia and other language learning
disorders, show lower levels of gamma activities than children without these disorders. This is a 
strong indication for the possibility that brain waves also affect language learning skills. Gamma 
waves are important for the process of parsing words into sounds.

**gammabeat** is a personal collection of R projects, experiments, and thoughts on these topics.
