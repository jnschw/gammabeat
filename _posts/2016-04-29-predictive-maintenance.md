### Predictive Maintenance


For developing predictive models typically decision trees, support vector 
machines and ensemble methods are used.

Maintenance strategies:

 * Reactive: run to failure (breakdown)
 * Preventative: planed and scheduled on fixed time intervals (or distance), 
or based on predetermined conditions (oil pressure warning, mil) 
 * Predictive: online condition based monitoring and analysis



#### Cox regression models

packages: survival


#### Random Forest CART


CART models

packages: rpart, partykit


#### Time series models

AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA

packages: forecast



#### Practical predictive analytics

The *Predictive Model Markup Language* (PMML) is the de facto standard to 
represent predictive analytics and data mining models.
